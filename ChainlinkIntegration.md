# Chainlink Integration for ImpactLink

Chainlink's oracle services play a pivotal role in the ImpactLink ecosystem, ensuring a seamless fusion of on-chain and off-chain data.

## Data Points:

- Course details from educational institutions.
- Accreditation information.
- Real-world impact data for environmental projects, such as reforestation rates or clean energy adoption metrics.

We utilize Chainlink's Data Feeds and Cross-Chain Interoperability Protocol (CCIP) for these integrations.
